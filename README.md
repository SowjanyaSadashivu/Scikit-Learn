# Scikit-Learn
Scikit-learn is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python. provides a wide range of tools for various machine learning tasks, including: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Ensemble Learning, Feature Engineering etc.,  In this repository we see the use and implementation of scikit learn to solve various ML problems.

*  A PDF file that explains the classification models, different classifiers in sklearn, Loss functions, PCA, LDA, QDA and more in detail.
*  Image classification model using Logistic regression and SGDclassifier with accuracy upto 84%
*  Exploratory data analysis on Titanic data. Dataset collected from Kaggle.
**  Handled the missing values.
   * Handling Categorical data.
   * understanding the correlation between features.
   * save the processed data into csv file for further usage.
*  Hyperparameter tuning with GridsearchCV
  **  Pick the right parameters that gives best results based on the outcome og GridSearchCv results.
   ** use those parameters to train the model for accurate results.

*  Apply different classification models on the preprocessed data, to identify the best model to get most accurate results.
*  Of all the model, SVM performed well with 80% accuracy on train data and 79% accuracy on test data.
